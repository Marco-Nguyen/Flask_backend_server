# Flask backend server

It's not so hard to understand, isn't it? :dizzy_face:

Quick access:

1. client: `client.py` - run on client side, eg: Raspberry Pi
2. messages: sample messages send and receive 
3. server: several servers for testing and using. Up to now, `server_Dat.py` is the most complete one.
4. static: some sample images to test the system
5. test: just a draft to test the model

To do:

- [ ] use custom model for `server_Dat.py`
- [ ] change model handling for `server_Hiep.py`
- [ ] Enjoy the work :partying_face:
